# Clean Email

Clean Email is a web application that can generate clean looking email for newsletters or mailing lists.

It strikes a balance between the fancy, colorful, and frankly, brittle HTML templates and regular old plain text by using a plain text look-alike HTML template with some additional HTML features.

## Usage

1. Run the application
2. Copy your email content
3. Generate the clean email
4. Copy the output into your newsletter service of choice (e.g. Aweber, Mailchimp)

## Features

* Convert content into a simple HTML template (Coming soon)
* Convert content into a plain text template, with word wrapping (Coming soon)
* Autolink HTML content (Coming soon)
* Inline CSS (better deliverability, no remote resource loading) (Coming soon)
* Syntax highlighting for code (yes, code in emails. It works) (Coming soon)
